Configuration Files
===================
Those are my configuration files for zsh and vim. They have been tested with OS X and Linux.

Run `./install.sh` to add the files to your own configuration files. They create links to these files rather than copy their contents, so that running `git pull` in the repository will update your config with the new changes to this config.
